{"name":"Grimoire","tagline":"Functional 5e spell list by class and level","body":"# Grimoire\r\n\r\nGrimoire is a mobile-friendly 5e spellbook that organizes spell lists by class and level.\r\n\r\nSee the latest compiled build here: <estivo-alexio.github.io/grimoire>\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n* 8/8/15: Merged the rest of the spells in, started adding links to spell references, and pushed a new build. Thanks everyone!\r\n* 6/8/15: Merged pull requests and pushed a new build.\r\n* 5/29/15: Merged pull requests and pushed a new build. Thanks, y'all!\r\n* 5/1/15: Many belated spell additions, thanks to @jayrab, @zetsevs, and @LukasCaller. Also table styles for web, though no real mobile support yet.\r\n* 1/1/15: Merged in several level 3 and level 4 spells, thanks to @jayrab, @zetsevs, and @LukasCaller.\r\n* 12/31/14: Added Cleric level 2 spells from the starter kit, merged in some bard spells from jayrab.\r\n* 9/30/14: Added rest of Wizard level 1 spells.\r\n* 9/26/14: Added Sorcerer and Warlock cantrips, and Ranger, Sorcerer and Warlock level 1 spells. Also Remove Curse and the level 3 category. Spell level links on spell pages now go to the level subsection in the full spell list (home) instead of a broken subpage.\r\n* 9/25/14: Added Druid cantrips and Druid and Paladin level 1 spells.\r\n* Added all Bard cantrips and level 1 spells.\r\n* Added Wizard cantrips and level 1 from the starter kit.\r\n* Added all Cleric cantrips and level 1 spells.\r\n\r\n## To Do\r\n* Create another layout for the spell level tag pages (e.g. cantrip, level1). Also figure out what to do with those pages.\r\n* Find a real home for class specializations (e.g. cleric's domains)\r\n* Clean up header and navigation scheme.\r\n* Figure out mobile styles for tables. Also /fistshake at whoever decided tables in spell lists were a good idea.\r\n\r\n## Structure\r\nSpells can be found inside `_posts/`. Each spell gets its own post, written and stored as a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) file. The date is arbitrary and never displayed, but still necessary for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to process the posts properly.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to help fill out the rest of the spells from the PHB, for each new spell you make:\r\n\r\n1. Make a new post inside `_posts/` for each new spell, and copy the formatting from another spell.\r\n2. Submit a pull request for the spell(s) when you're finished, and that's it! Thank you so much. :)\r\n\r\n## Build Instructions\r\nI've edited _config.yml for my own build purposes, but if you've got [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) set up locally, the following should create the build from your friendly command line terminal:\r\n`jekyll serve -Vw --no-watch --baseurl \"\"`\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nCleric and wizard spells from the Starter Kit were seeded from [this Reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2a7wau/5e_cleric_and_wizard_spells_sorted_by_level/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
